# Understanding of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)
#### Continuous integration (CI) and Continuous delievry (CD) are a part of software development life cycle (SDLC) process. Through automation, CI/CD pipelines aim to enhance software delivery throughout the software development life cycle. Modern development techniques like DevOps typically employ CI and CD {atlassin}. As the software industry gets more competitive, businesses invest more time and money into creating and delivering high-quality software more quickly [Iee]. CI and CD are two of the features that facilitate growth acceleration and effiecient product delivery. While assuring code quality and software security, CI/CD allows software development teams to concentrate on satisfying business needs.

## Continuous Integration (CI)
#### Continuous integration is a technique for software development where developers are in charge of adding code updates to a single, shared repository. Continuous integration encourages developers to merge changes back to the main branch frequently. By making a build and testing it with automated tools, the developer's modifications are verified [1]. This technique allows to fix bugs early in the SDLC which reduces time in releasing softwares with the developers having the most recent updated code; it allows them to merge different code all at once [3]. It produces higher quality code but at a faster pace. 

## Continuous Development
#### Continuous delivery is a continuation of continuous integration because it automatically deploys any modification to the code to a testing and/or production environment following the build stage [1]. Software updates are generated and evaluated after being put into a common repository as part of the continuous delivery process before being made available for use in the production environment. The purpose of this is to automate the process in such a way that new projects and updates can released efficiently [3]. It enables the business orginasions to change and fulfil the demands of the users in an efficient way. 


# What are some tools that are used for this and why are they used
#### Some of the tools that are used for CI/CD are listed below [2]: 

#### Jenkins: With 100 of plug-ins, jenkins is a open source platform which has free agent license pricing and supported by Windows, Linux, and MacOS. One of the key features of this software is its user friendly interface with easy installation, and convenient configuration. 
#### CircleCI: Although this software has a free version, it's not an open source software. The positive side of CircleCI is it can be integrated with GitHub and Bitbucket. It has easy debugging feature which can be run in a virtual machine or a container. It's feasible with customisation but only supported oninux or MacOS.
#### TeamCity: Similar to CircleCI it's not an open source software but supports GitLab, Visual Studion and IDE integration. It can run parallely on different environments . This commercial tool supports windows, linux, macOS, and Solaris.
#### GitLab: GitLab is not an open source but provides agent license pricing with only $4 a month. It runs on Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian. It enables developers to build, run tests and deploy with commit or push. It allows the delivery team to completely embrace CI by automating it. It's a commercial tool which offers SAAS.
